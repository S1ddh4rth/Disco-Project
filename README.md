## Abstract

This project attempts to find a solution for optimization of university course assignments within a department, where faculty
members can handle multiple course loads and have their own preference order. The primary objective revolves around
fulfilling course allocations while adhering to individual preferences and category-based constraints. The problem is solved
employing a penalty-based assignment strategy and utilizing the Hungarian algorithm for weighted graphs. The findings
underscore the suitability and effectiveness of this tailored approach in solving the complex course assignment optimization
problem. The paper presents a few test cases and a set of close to optimal solutions generated by the code implementation
